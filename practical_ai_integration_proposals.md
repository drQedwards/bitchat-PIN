```swift
// Proposed AI Router Service
class AIRoutingService {
    private let networkModel: SimpleNeuralNetwork
    private let trainingData: NetworkMetricsCollector
    
    func optimizeRoute(for message: Message, availablePeers: [Peer]) -> [Peer] {
        let features = extractNetworkFeatures(peers: availablePeers)
        let predictions = networkModel.predict(features: features)
        return rankPeersByPrediction(peers: availablePeers, predictions: predictions)
    }
    
    func updateModel(with networkFeedback: NetworkMetrics) {
        trainingData.add(feedback: networkFeedback)
        if trainingData.shouldRetrain() {
            networkModel.train(data: trainingData.getTrainingSet())
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Natural Language Processing for Chat Enhancement

**Concept**: Integrate lightweight NLP capabilities for improved user experience.

**Features**:
- **Message Intent Classification**: Identify message types (questions, commands, announcements)
- **Smart Auto-complete**: Context-aware message completion
- **Content Moderation**: Local AI-based content filtering
- **Language Translation**: Offline translation for international mesh networks

**Implementation Approach**:
```swift
// Proposed NLP Enhancement Service
class ChatAIService {
    private let intentClassifier: CoreMLModel
    private let autoCompleteModel: CoreMLModel
    private let translationModel: CoreMLModel
    
    func classifyMessageIntent(_ message: String) -> MessageIntent {
        return intentClassifier.prediction(from: message)
    }
    
    func suggestCompletion(for partialMessage: String, context: ChatContext) -> [String] {
        return autoCompleteModel.generateSuggestions(partial: partialMessage, context: context)
    }
    
    func translateMessage(_ message: String, to language: Language) -> String {
        return translationModel.translate(message, targetLanguage: language)
    }
}
```

### 3. Predictive Store-and-Forward System

**Concept**: Use AI to predict when peers will be available and optimize message caching strategies.

**Technical Details**:
- **Peer Availability Prediction**: Learn patterns of when users are online
- **Smart Cache Management**: Prioritize message storage based on delivery probability
- **Network Health Monitoring**: Predict network partitions and connectivity issues

### 4. Federated Learning Framework

**Concept**: Implement a federated learning system using the mesh network infrastructure.

**Benefits**:
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Models train locally, only sharing gradients
- **Decentralized AI**: No central server required
- **Research Platform**: Foundation for distributed AI experiments

```swift
// Proposed Federated Learning Service
class FederatedLearningService {
    private let localModel: TrainableModel
    private let gradientAggregator: GradientAggregator
    
    func trainLocalModel(with localData: [TrainingExample]) {
        localModel.train(data: localData)
    }
    
    func shareGradients() -> ModelGradients {
        return localModel.getGradients()
    }
    
    func aggregateGradients(from peers: [Peer]) {
        let gradients = collectGradientsFromPeers(peers)
        let aggregatedGradients = gradientAggregator.aggregate(gradients)
        localModel.applyGradients(aggregatedGradients)
